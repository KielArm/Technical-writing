## Purpose of project
  For this documentation project, wel will be discussing the pros and cons of certain spacey tutorials that discuss how to use the NER(Named Entity Recognition). NER are tags that text has to help identify what they are, examples being: Fred(person), City Hall(Building), London(GPE). From this project we will learn what are some helpful skills that making learning NERs helpful and what advice is harmful to beginners who are learning.

## Purpose of documentation
This documentation is to help follow along on the process of researching and analyzing three different Spacey tutorials on how to use NER. It will go over the SWOT of all three tutorials and then explains as a whole, what are helpful tips and how to improve upon the learning of NERs.

## Usability goals
From my recommendations, a user will be able to easily follow along and understand the process of how to use NERs through Spacey on Google colab. The recommendations will be through steps that are not wordy to avoid confusing the users with jargon they may not know or understand. 

## Product Description
Spacey core function is to help make processing data and words simpler through the use of codes. The program helps in simplifying the data and organizing it for the user’s benefit. Spacey, at least in this class, is primarily run on Google Colabs which is another coding program that accepts different kinds of templates. Another tool required to help Spacey run more smoothly is the language processor, there are other types of processors for english and other languages, but a primary one used is “nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')” due to how fast it runs on Colabs. Through the use of Spacey, data management and processing will become easier for all users, however there is a lot of information in Spacey itself that needs to be learned and practiced. While there are several tutorials out they are not the most clear and concise on what is important or what certain keywords/terms mean. This becomes more harmful when copying and pasting becomes a better solution than writing out long codes. The lies in the fact, though copying and then pasting is easier, they don’t retain much of the information in those short increments of practice.

## Audience Profile
From my exposure from different users of Spacey, I have acquired different PoVs on the subject of spacey’s usability. From what I gathered, Users want easy to follow instructions on the different functions and use of code. Additionally, I noticed users have an easier time first copying the code and seeing how it works first before doing it on their own. Finally, an important note I had made was that having a short list of tags or jargons explaining what they are would help with usability in tutorials.

## Competitive review
### RealPython:
Strength- It starts off by explaining what NERs are and how they are used before beginning the tutorial. The tutorial gives a visual example of how NERs work and what the codes should look like. You are about to copy the code as shown.
Weakness- There are no steps to follow in this tutorial, it only shows you what the code should look like at the end. Due to this, if a person doesn’t copy and paste, or even if they do, they will have a hard time understanding what they are doing and what each line of code means. It also explains the labels/tokens that it used.
Opportunities- From this tutorial a user would learn how to redact names from text as this tutorial shows how to do so. Also since you can copy and paste, you won’t have to souffle back and forth to make sure you entered the code correctly.
Threats- A huge threat to this tutorial is error messages. Since it doesn’t give proper steps on how to do the NERs process, if an error message appears for a beginner doing this, they will have no idea as to what this error is referring to and how to fix said error. 

### MachineLearningPlus:
Strength- Is a basic tutorial for how to use Spacey and have easy to follow instructions that are broken down and shown visually. MLP also gives descriptions of NER entities and what each. Also tell you how to uses Displacey at the end which can make the visualization easier.
Weakness- Due the steps being broken down but not put together, the user may not know how the final product is supposed to look. 
Opportunities-This is a clear and easy to learn tutorial that doesn’t use difficult wording or hard to follow instructions. From this tutorial a beginner could learn how to use NERs with spacey without much issue. 
Threats- The main threat here is that it is basic, this is a simple tutorial and nothing more. It doesn’t help advance you if you already know NERs, it was made for beginners and so only beginners will get something out of it.

### AnalyticsVidhya:
Strength- It gives an explanation of how to use NERs and also shows a visual of how to write the code to find NERs in a text. It also shows how to just write out the code that explains said attributes connected to entities. 
Weakness- This tutorial doesn’t fully explain it’s steps nor show them the way it should be. It only shows the code but not what happens when you play the code, insteading writing it out. Due to this, the user won't even know if the code works or not.
Opportunities- It’s quick and simple to follow. It useful for as a refreshing on how to find NERs
Threats- It does not show the finished product which can lead to errors and mistakes very easily when a user follows along. Personally could not recommend this tutorial to beginners. 

## Design Implications
From the product reviews and the audience needs I have come up with some help recommendations for how to create a proper tutorial for beginners in using spacey. 
I believe MLP did a great job in teaching beginners how to use Spacey, however it needs to show the finished product all put together so that the user knows what theirs should look like.
There should be a short list of NERs entity tags so that a user knows what they are. It isn’t enough to just know how to do something but you must also know what you are doing. By providing these tag descriptions, the user can then be able to know what NERs belong where just by looking, then be able to detect any errors or mistakes when the played code isn’t working or appears to have a mistake. 
None of the Tutorials above had written out steps on what to do, The MLP one did however have markdowns. While I personally have no issue with markdowns and like the use of them, a beginner who is learning spacey will have problems copying them if they are just doing copy and paste. To avoid this I say the creator of a tutorial should have written out steps of each major line of code outside of the visual code examples so that the user can first process the instructions and then see the visual representation.
Errors, while it is a wasted effort to write down every error that could appear and how each error means, One should at least let the user know that errors could occur. While there is nothing wrong with errors as they help users learn, there should be a FAQ part that talk about frequent errors that can occur. This is an issue that copying and pasting is supposed to avoid but if you put the codes in the wrong place, an error will occur and the user will be left confused since all they did was copy and paste. 
I liked how each tutorial explained NERs and what they were. A small introduction into a topic goes a long way in helping someone understand what they are doing. 

## Challenges
A major and important roadblock that could and did affect this documentation is the competitive review. All of my recommendations, advice, knowledge, and issues stem from the tutorials that are analyzed here. Meaning, if I looked at all bad tutorials, I would be basing my thought off of that which could lead to two outcomes: Me stating information that is already fixed and known, or me believing that since all three tutorials gave the same bad instructions that they are the correct way to go about said tutorials. The same issue can be said with reviewing three great tutorials as there would probably be not much for me to recommend or fix.
