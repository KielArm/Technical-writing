<h1> How to create a folder in GitHub Repository </h1>

<p> The first step to creating a folder in a Repository is to first create a new file, this will make sense in a moment. <b> Click on add file then create new file </b>.

<p> Once you have created the new file, you will see your Repository, type a "/" and a prompt telling you to name your file. this will actually become your folder. <b> name the folder the desired name and then put a "/" </b>

<p> once you have done that, a new folder with that name will be created and you will then be able to add a file to it. <b> Rememeber that you can not have a emepty folder and that atleast one file must exist within the folder for it to be recognized by GitHub.</b>
